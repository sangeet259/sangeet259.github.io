      <title>HTTP in HTTPS proxy</title>

      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy I am tempted to something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;rdquo; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;rdquo; only.
I have previously been caught in problem due to this. The lates one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.
Thankfully this stackoverflow answer saved the day : https://stackoverflow.com/a/51648635/6507303</description>

      <title>XClip in Fish Shell</title>

      <description>Wondered if you could just copy the output of a bash command to clipboard and paste it somewhere.
XClip is here for your rescue. The Fish Shell 3.0 now supports xclip.
How to use :
 For copying  $pwd | xclip  Paste it  $cd (xclip -o)   PS: In fish to execute a string as a command use paranthesis &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; instead of backticks &amp;ldquo; ` ` &amp;ldquo;.</description>
