I had encountered several times words like `map`, `zip`, `lambda`, `*args`, `**kwargs`.
This time I decided to look up the web and really get the hang of them.
So here I was searching the net.
Finally I came across some nice explaations which I pen down here :

1. Map, Zip and Lamda :: https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/pythons-zip-map-and-lambda/
2. **Args and **Kwargs :: https://pythontips.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/
