## Hellooo World !<br>
Okay So it's already noon and I am setting up up my portfolio. While I already had a portfolio built in the summer as part of the SF Web Team Selections , but that one looked very childish and lacked professionalism. I was still sticking around with it until I saw [Himanshu Mishra's](http://orkohunter.net/) and [Dibya Das's](https://dibyadas.github.io/) portfolio . I was amazed that how simplistic these guys had made their portfolio.<br>
Straight to the point , No Flashy !.<br>
----<br>
So I decided to build my portfolio on their lines. Then one day [Rakesh](https://rakeshbal99.github.io) showed me [Rohit Jena's](https://github.com/rohitrango) portfolio , and I was like  , yes this is what I wanted , not too flashy and beautiful . I found that he used the [Beutiful Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). But it still needed a bit of work to be used directly. So I asked him if I can use his work , and he was kind enough :) .<br>
So now I am finishing set up with this site and leaving to study Solid Mechanics as there is a test tomorrow  !<br>

<br>
Tada!
