      <title>Python Site Packages vs Dist Packages</title>
      <link>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/python-site-vs-dist-packages/</link>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/python-site-vs-dist-packages/</guid>
      <description>There are certain locations Python looks for installed packages. You can find out the locations :
import sys print &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;.join(sys.path) /usr/lib/python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload /home/sangeet/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages dist-package in specific to Debian/Ubuntu distros. The modules that comes from a Debian Package manager are installed in the dist-packages. /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Since pip also comes from a Debian package manager, they too use &amp;lsquo;dist-packages&amp;rsquo; in Debian/Ubuntu. But their path is &amp;lsquo;a bit&amp;rsquo; different.</description>

      <title>Set Proxy for all the Docker files</title>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/proxy-for-docker-files/</guid>
      <description>So I was using a docker container. Docker was already infmaous in my eyes because the way it sets up proxy. I remember wasting a lot of time initially only to find out that you have to create som proxy-conf.d file in order to enable proxy usange in docker.
Now came using Docker Images. So I had this image where I had a pip install running, when I docker-compose up-ed, there seemed some glitch, but it was familiar, it striked me, it was PROXY issue !</description>

      <description>There are some features in sublime that I absolutely love.
Three of them :
 ctrl + P : Opens up a input field where you can search for files across the entire project. ctrl + R : Search for a method/function in the current opened file. ctrl + shift + R : Search for method/function across the entire project.  </description>

      <title>Categorical Cross Entropy vs Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy</title>
      <link>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/cat-ce-vs-sparse-cat-ce/</link>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/cat-ce-vs-sparse-cat-ce/</guid>
      <description>I was looking for a loss function when browsing through Keras documentation I found two loss functions. The first one categorical_cross_entropy was familiar, however I saw something I had never used before it was sparsed_categorical_cross_entropy.
The difference : Depends on the structure of your targets !
If your targets are one-hot encoded, you have to use categorical_crossentropy. Examples of one-hot encoding:
[1,0,0] [0,1,0] [0,0,1] But if your targets are integers, use sparse_categorical_crossentropy.</description>

      <description>So I was browsing TensorFlow doc on the Dataset API, when I stumbled across something which eventually led me to learn this:
You can pass a key function(or a lambda) to the min/max function in Python.
Here is a sweet example:
def sumDigit(num): sum = 0 while(num): sum += num % 10 num = int(num / 10) return sum # using min(arg1, arg2, *args, key) print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(100, 321, 267, 59, 40, key=sumDigit)) # using min(iterable, key) num = [15, 300, 2700, 821, 52, 10, 6] print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(num, key=sumDigit)) Source : https://www.</description>

      <description>So there was a Data Science competition and after a long long time, I was doing something in Deep Learning. I was looking at colab when I saw this term &amp;ldquo;Eager Execution&amp;rdquo; popping up.
So there I was trying to figure out what it was. Here in this article I try to summarise what I learnt from various sources.
What it is? It&amp;rsquo;s a new imperative. The pythonic way of using tensorflow.</description>

      <title>Understanding Context Managers in Python</title>

      <description>So I was working on the evolve command next (hg next). Here my work was with context managers, although I had used context managers before this time I wanted to know a bit more about them.
So I read this blog on Context Managers : https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/
Few takeways:  Used to manage resources One of the most famous use : Handling file descriptors   How does a file descriptor leak ?</description>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/posts/evolve-from-source/</guid>
      <description>I was working on Evolve. I made some changes to it&amp;rsquo;s codebase, at this point it becomes very important to me to see the effect of the changes that I make, because unlike others who just trust their code and directly run tests on the code.
I don&amp;rsquo;t run tests unless I see the working of the code I write.
Doing this for Mercurial repo was easier, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do much.</description>

      <description>To access your Google Drive files in Colab. You first need to mount it in your notebook.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do that:
from google.colab import drive drive.mount(&amp;#39;/content/drive&amp;#39;) After this you would be asked for authorisation and provided with a token, copy and paste that token back to mount your notebook at /content/drive/ My Drive.
From this point onward you can use cd and ls to explore your drive and go where the data is.</description>

      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy, I am tempted to do something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; only.
I have previously been caught in problems due to this. The latest one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.

      <description>Wondered if you could just copy the output of a bash command to clipboard and paste it somewhere.
XClip is here for your rescue. The Fish Shell 3.0 now supports xclip.
How to use :
 For copying  $pwd | xclip   Paste it  $cd (xclip -o)    PS: In fish to execute a string as a command use paranthesis &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; instead of backticks &amp;quot; ` ` &amp;ldquo;.</description>

I did my project under Python Software Foundation and Mercurial. My project in the GSoC’18 dealt with the grepping aspect of Mecurial
Now, before diving into it, making some things clear from the title.

      <description>GSoC Blog post #7 This week I worked on passing multiple revisions to the –allfiles flag.
The PR can be found at https://phab.mercurial-scm.org/D3976
It’s assumed that if you are passing multiple revisions to –allfiles, you want hits from all of them. This was the behaviour that was chose after a discussion with Yuya.
The initial patch that I had sent had a different behaviour.
It made sure it just check the files only once by maintaining a dictionary called files.</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog post #6 At the beginning of this week, my previous commit was revert and set to config = False, meaning that it is hidden behind that config option. That’s because it was a period of code freeze in mercurial as the next release is due in some days, so unless a feature is completely tested it can’t be released.
Link to the revision: https://phab.mercurial-scm.org/D3919
Next Yuya told me to work on passing multiple revisions with –all-files mode.</description>

      <description>GSOC Blog Post #5 This time I was working on changing the default of the grep command to a new behaviour.
With this patch grep searches on the working directory by default and looks for all files tracked by the working directory and greps on them
==========================Demonstration================
OLD BEHAVIOUR
$ hg init a $ cd a $ echo &amp;#34;some text&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;file1 $ hg add file1 $ hg commit -m &amp;#34;adds file1&amp;#34; $ hg mv file1 file2 $ hg grep &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; file2:1:some text file1:0:some text This behaviour is undesirable since file1 is not in the current history and was renamed as file2, so the second result was redundant and confusing</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog Post #4 Another Fortnight gone by, and perhaps this was the time when we got most work done.
This time around I added two new features to mercurial.
They are: The allfiles mode
This would work on a single revision and get all the files that were there in that revision. So it’s like grepping on a previous state. Using this with wdir() :: hg grep -r &amp;ldquo;wdir()&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;allfiles is what the default behaviour is desired for grep.</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog Post 3 These two weeks I was involved in fixing the –wdir(). Yuya had asked me to not create an entire separate if/else block as that might lead to untested code paths.
So I was trying to work out another way. While I was trying to figure out a way to do this I realised the code had changed a bit since my last patch, and it nows throws WdirUnsupported exception.</description>

      <description>So it is two weeks into the coding period and I thankfully haven’t fallen much behind my own set timeline.
The tasks that I had set this week were fixing the&amp;ndash;all flag and fix the working directory grep. Thankfully I had done major of this work during/after submission. The fix of the &amp;ndash;all was tested and merged and is a part of the stable version of hg now.
The best part of the issue was that fixing it took just changing two lines.</description>

      <description>Demonstrating the problem with forward ordered grep --``all So if you do a hg grep &amp;quot;pattern&amp;quot; --all, you would get all the lines along with revision numbers showing when this pattern appeared or disappeared from the repository. Cool, that’s what we want.
And by default, it does a reverse revlog search. That is, it starts from the latest revision and goes all the way upto the oldest one. And accordingly shows you the result.</description>

Then you&amp;rsquo;re options are :
 First install tkinter, note that since you do not have sudo priviledge, you have to install tcl8.6-dev and tk8.6-dev from source too.</description>

 Okay So it&amp;rsquo;s already noon and I am setting up up my portfolio. While I already had a portfolio built in the summer as part of the SF Web Team Selections , but that one looked very childish and lacked professionalism. I was still sticking around with it until I saw Himanshu Mishra&amp;rsquo;s and Dibya Das&amp;rsquo;s portfolio . I was amazed that how simplistic these guys had made their portfolio.</description>

      <description>CUDA Set Up  The last time I tried to fiddle with CUDA I got stuck in a login loop and had to reinstall Ubuntu. Last day again I was sitting in front of a fresh installation of Ubuntu and nightmares of last time&amp;rsquo;s Tensorflow GPU setup were all but moments away.
Anyway I had to do it.
But surprisingly this time it was short and simple ( simpler would hae been a better choice ).</description>
