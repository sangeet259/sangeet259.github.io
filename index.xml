      <title>Python Site Packages vs Dist Packages</title>
      <link>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/python-site-vs-dist-packages/</link>

      <description>There are certain locations Python looks for installed packages. You can find out the locations :
import sys print &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;.join(sys.path) /usr/lib/python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload /home/sangeet/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages dist-package in specific to Debian/Ubuntu distros. The modules that comes from a Debian Package manager are installed in the dist-packages. /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Since pip also comes from a Debian package manager, they too use &amp;lsquo;dist-packages&amp;rsquo; in Debian/Ubuntu. But their path is &amp;lsquo;a bit&amp;rsquo; different.</description>

      <title>Set Proxy for all the Docker files</title>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/proxy-for-docker-files/</guid>
      <description>So I was using a docker container. Docker was already infmaous in my eyes because the way it sets up proxy. I remember wasting a lot of time initially only to find out that you have to create som proxy-conf.d file in order to enable proxy usange in docker.
Now came using Docker Images. So I had this image where I had a pip install running, when I docker-compose up-ed, there seemed some glitch, but it was familiar, it striked me, it was PROXY issue !</description>

      <description>There are some features in sublime that I absolutely love.
Three of them :
 ctrl + P : Opens up a input field where you can search for files across the entire project. ctrl + R : Search for a method/function in the current opened file. ctrl + shift + R : Search for method/function across the entire project.  </description>

      <title>Categorical Cross Entropy vs Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy</title>
      <link>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/cat-ce-vs-sparse-cat-ce/</link>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/cat-ce-vs-sparse-cat-ce/</guid>
      <description>I was looking for a loss function when browsing through Keras documentation I found two loss functions. The first one categorical_cross_entropy was familiar, however I saw something I had never used before it was sparsed_categorical_cross_entropy.
The difference : Depends on the structure of your targets !
If your targets are one-hot encoded, you have to use categorical_crossentropy. Examples of one-hot encoding:
[1,0,0] [0,1,0] [0,0,1] But if your targets are integers, use sparse_categorical_crossentropy.</description>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/til/key-in-min_max/</guid>
      <description>So I was browsing TensorFlow doc on the Dataset API, when I stumbled across something which eventually led me to learn this:
You can pass a key function(or a lambda) to the min/max function in Python.
Here is a sweet example:
def sumDigit(num): sum = 0 while(num): sum += num % 10 num = int(num / 10) return sum # using min(arg1, arg2, *args, key) print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(100, 321, 267, 59, 40, key=sumDigit)) # using min(iterable, key) num = [15, 300, 2700, 821, 52, 10, 6] print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(num, key=sumDigit)) Source : https://www.</description>

      <description>So there was a Data Science competition and after a long long time, I was doing something in Deep Learning. I was looking at colab when I saw this term &amp;ldquo;Eager Execution&amp;rdquo; popping up.
So there I was trying to figure out what it was. Here in this article I try to summarise what I learnt from various sources.
What it is? It&amp;rsquo;s a new imperative. The pythonic way of using tensorflow.</description>

      <title>Understanding Context Managers in Python</title>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/posts/ctx-in-python/</guid>
      <description>So I was working on the evolve command next (hg next). Here my work was with context managers, although I had used context managers before this time I wanted to know a bit more about them.
So I read this blog on Context Managers : https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/
Few takeways:  Used to manage resources One of the most famous use : Handling file descriptors   How does a file descriptor leak ?</description>

      <guid>https://sangeetmishra.in/posts/evolve-from-source/</guid>
      <description>I was working on Evolve. I made some changes to it&amp;rsquo;s codebase, at this point it becomes very important to me to see the effect of the changes that I make, because unlike others who just trust their code and directly run tests on the code.
I don&amp;rsquo;t run tests unless I see the working of the code I write.
Doing this for Mercurial repo was easier, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do much.</description>

      <description>To access your Google Drive files in Colab. You first need to mount it in your notebook.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do that:
from google.colab import drive drive.mount(&amp;#39;/content/drive&amp;#39;) After this you would be asked for authorisation and provided with a token, copy and paste that token back to mount your notebook at /content/drive/ My Drive.
From this point onward you can use cd and ls to explore your drive and go where the data is.</description>

      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy, I am tempted to do something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;quot; only.
I have previously been caught in problems due to this. The latest one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.

      <description>Wondered if you could just copy the output of a bash command to clipboard and paste it somewhere.
XClip is here for your rescue. The Fish Shell 3.0 now supports xclip.
How to use :
 For copying  $pwd | xclip   Paste it  $cd (xclip -o)    PS: In fish to execute a string as a command use paranthesis &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; instead of backticks &amp;quot; ` ` &amp;ldquo;.</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog post #7 This week I worked on passing multiple revisions to the –allfiles flag.
The PR can be found at https://phab.mercurial-scm.org/D3976
It’s assumed that if you are passing multiple revisions to –allfiles, you want hits from all of them. This was the behaviour that was chose after a discussion with Yuya.
The initial patch that I had sent had a different behaviour.
It made sure it just check the files only once by maintaining a dictionary called files.</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog post #6 At the beginning of this week, my previous commit was revert and set to config = False, meaning that it is hidden behind that config option. That’s because it was a period of code freeze in mercurial as the next release is due in some days, so unless a feature is completely tested it can’t be released.
Link to the revision: https://phab.mercurial-scm.org/D3919
Next Yuya told me to work on passing multiple revisions with –all-files mode.</description>

      <description>GSOC Blog Post #5 This time I was working on changing the default of the grep command to a new behaviour.
With this patch grep searches on the working directory by default and looks for all files tracked by the working directory and greps on them
==========================Demonstration================
OLD BEHAVIOUR
$ hg init a $ cd a $ echo &amp;#34;some text&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;file1 $ hg add file1 $ hg commit -m &amp;#34;adds file1&amp;#34; $ hg mv file1 file2 $ hg grep &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; file2:1:some text file1:0:some text This behaviour is undesirable since file1 is not in the current history and was renamed as file2, so the second result was redundant and confusing</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog Post #4 Another Fortnight gone by, and perhaps this was the time when we got most work done.
This time around I added two new features to mercurial.
They are: The allfiles mode
This would work on a single revision and get all the files that were there in that revision. So it’s like grepping on a previous state. Using this with wdir() :: hg grep -r &amp;ldquo;wdir()&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;allfiles is what the default behaviour is desired for grep.</description>

      <description>GSoC Blog Post 3 These two weeks I was involved in fixing the –wdir(). Yuya had asked me to not create an entire separate if/else block as that might lead to untested code paths.
So I was trying to work out another way. While I was trying to figure out a way to do this I realised the code had changed a bit since my last patch, and it nows throws WdirUnsupported exception.</description>

      <description>So it is two weeks into the coding period and I thankfully haven’t fallen much behind my own set timeline.
The tasks that I had set this week were fixing the&amp;ndash;all flag and fix the working directory grep. Thankfully I had done major of this work during/after submission. The fix of the &amp;ndash;all was tested and merged and is a part of the stable version of hg now.
The best part of the issue was that fixing it took just changing two lines.</description>

      <description>Demonstrating the problem with forward ordered grep --``all So if you do a hg grep &amp;quot;pattern&amp;quot; --all, you would get all the lines along with revision numbers showing when this pattern appeared or disappeared from the repository. Cool, that’s what we want.
And by default, it does a reverse revlog search. That is, it starts from the latest revision and goes all the way upto the oldest one. And accordingly shows you the result.</description>

Anyway I had to do it.
But surprisingly this time it was short and simple ( simpler would hae been a better choice ).</description>
