      <description>I had encountered several times words like map, zip, lambda, *args, **kwargs. This time I decided to look up the web and really get the hang of them. So here I was searching the net. Finally I came across some nice explaations which I pen down here :
 Map, Zip and Lamda :: https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/pythons-zip-map-and-lambda/ **Args and **Kwargs :: https://pythontips.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/  </description>
