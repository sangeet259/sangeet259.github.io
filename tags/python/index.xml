      <description>So I was browsing TensorFlow doc on the Dataset API, when I stumbled across something which eventually led me to learn this:
You can pass a key function(or a lambda) to the min/max function in Python.
Here is a sweet example:
def sumDigit(num): sum = 0 while(num): sum += num % 10 num = int(num / 10) return sum # using min(arg1, arg2, *args, key) print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(100, 321, 267, 59, 40, key=sumDigit)) # using min(iterable, key) num = [15, 300, 2700, 821, 52, 10, 6] print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(num, key=sumDigit)) Source : https://www.</description>

      <description>So I was working on the evolve command next (hg next). Here my work was with context managers, although I had used context managers before this time I wanted to know a bit more about them.
So I read this blog on Context Managers : https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/
Few takeways:  Used to manage resources One of the most famous use : Handling file descriptors   How does a file descriptor leak ?</description>

      <description>I had encountered several times words like map, zip, lambda, *args, **kwargs. This time I decided to look up the web and really get the hang of them. So here I was searching the net. Finally I came across some nice explaations which I pen down here :
 Map, Zip and Lamda :: https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/pythons-zip-map-and-lambda/ **Args and **Kwargs :: https://pythontips.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/  </description>
