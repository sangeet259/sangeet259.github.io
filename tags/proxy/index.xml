      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy, I am tempted to do something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; only.
I have previously been caught in problems due to this. The latest one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.
