      <title>HTTP in HTTPS proxy</title>

      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy I am tempted to something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;rdquo; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;rdquo; only.
I have previously been caught in problem due to this. The lates one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.
Thankfully this stackoverflow answer saved the day : https://stackoverflow.com/a/51648635/6507303</description>

      <title>XClip in Fish Shell</title>

      <description>Wondered if you could just copy the output of a bash command to clipboard and paste it somewhere.
XClip is here for your rescue. The Fish Shell 3.0 now supports xclip.
How to use :
 For copying  $pwd | xclip  Paste it  $cd (xclip -o)   PS: In fish to execute a string as a command use paranthesis &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; instead of backticks &amp;ldquo; ` ` &amp;ldquo;.</description>

      <description>Every time I re-install Ubnutu I have to search the web for the custom shell and git promp configurations. They are really handy for git completions.
  This time I thought to just put it down here.
Steps :
 Download : git-prompt.sh Save the above file as git-prompt.sh in the home directory Download : git-completion.bash Save the above file as git-completion.bash in the home directory Now open .bashrc file in any text editor and these lines at the end</description>

      <description>I was trying to use the Tensorflow&amp;rsquo;s newly released Object Detection API on my webcam. I realised I couldn&amp;rsquo;t open webcam, OpenCV which was bundled with ROS was throwing all sorts of errors, I Googled and tried many hacky solution but all in vain.
Now that my end sems were over I decided to install it fresh.
This site : https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/ is a great walktrough through the installation process. It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely complete.</description>

      <title>Setting Up CUDA</title>

      <description>CUDA Set Up The last time I tried to fiddle with CUDA I got stuck in a login loop and had to reinstall Ubuntu. Last day again I was sitting in front of a fresh installation of Ubuntu and nightmares of last time&amp;rsquo;s Tensorflow GPU setup were all but moments away.
Anyway I had to do it.
But surprisingly this time it was short and simple ( simpler would hae been a better choice ).</description>
