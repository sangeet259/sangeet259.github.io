      <title>Using Evolve from source</title>

      <description>I was working on Evolve. I made some changes to it&amp;rsquo;s codebase, at this point it becomes very important to me to see the effect of the changes that I make, because unlike others who just trust their code and directly run tests on the code.
I don&amp;rsquo;t run tests unless I see the working of the code I write.
Doing this for Mercurial repo was easier, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do much.</description>
