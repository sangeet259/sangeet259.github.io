      <description>I was trying to use the Tensorflow&amp;rsquo;s newly released Object Detection API on my webcam. I realised I couldn&amp;rsquo;t open webcam, OpenCV which was bundled with ROS was throwing all sorts of errors, I Googled and tried many hacky solution but all in vain.
Now that my end sems were over I decided to install it fresh.
This site : https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/ is a great walktrough through the installation process. It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely complete.</description>

      <description>CUDA Set Up The last time I tried to fiddle with CUDA I got stuck in a login loop and had to reinstall Ubuntu. Last day again I was sitting in front of a fresh installation of Ubuntu and nightmares of last time&amp;rsquo;s Tensorflow GPU setup were all but moments away.
Anyway I had to do it.
But surprisingly this time it was short and simple ( simpler would hae been a better choice ).</description>
