      <description>So I was using a docker container. Docker was already infmaous in my eyes because the way it sets up proxy. I remember wasting a lot of time initially only to find out that you have to create som proxy-conf.d file in order to enable proxy usange in docker.
Now came using Docker Images. So I had this image where I had a pip install running, when I docker-compose up-ed, there seemed some glitch, but it was familiar, it striked me, it was PROXY issue !</description>

      <title>HTTP in HTTPS proxy</title>

      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy, I am tempted to do something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;quot; only.
I have previously been caught in problems due to this. The latest one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.
