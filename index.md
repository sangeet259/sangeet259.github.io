My name is Sangeet Kumar Mishra , I am from Jajpur , Odisha. I am pursuing my undergaduate studies in Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in the Dept. of Civil Engineering. <br>
Interested in the field of Data Science , I love learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts , as it's everywhere and as **Andrew Ng** says it's the new electricty !<br>
Though I am a civil undergrad but love to I code all the time and learn. 

And all this is possible because of the great community IIT Kharagpur has !


**Some great seniors and cheerful friends is all you need to stay motivated !**<br>
