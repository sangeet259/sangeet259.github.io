      <title>Python Site Packages vs Dist Packages</title>
      <link>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/python-site-vs-dist-packages/</link>

      <description>There are certain locations Python looks for installed packages. You can find out the locations :
import sys print &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;.join(sys.path) /usr/lib/python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload /home/sangeet/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages dist-package in specific to Debian/Ubuntu distros. The modules that comes from a Debian Package manager are installed in the dist-packages. /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Since pip also comes from a Debian package manager, they too use &amp;lsquo;dist-packages&amp;rsquo; in Debian/Ubuntu. But their path is &amp;lsquo;a bit&amp;rsquo; different.</description>

      <title>Set Proxy for all the Docker files</title>
      <link>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/proxy-for-docker-files/</link>

      <description>So I was using a docker container. Docker was already infmaous in my eyes because the way it sets up proxy. I remember wasting a lot of time initially only to find out that you have to create som proxy-conf.d file in order to enable proxy usange in docker.
Now came using Docker Images. So I had this image where I had a pip install running, when I docker-compose up-ed, there seemed some glitch, but it was familiar, it striked me, it was PROXY issue !</description>

      <title>Project Level Methods/Function search in Sublime Text</title>

      <description>There are some features in sublime that I absolutely love.
Three of them :
 ctrl + P : Opens up a input field where you can search for files across the entire project. ctrl + R : Search for a method/function in the current opened file. ctrl + shift + R : Search for method/function across the entire project.  </description>

      <title>Categorical Cross Entropy vs Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy</title>
      <link>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/cat-ce-vs-sparse-cat-ce/</link>

      <guid>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/cat-ce-vs-sparse-cat-ce/</guid>
      <description>I was looking for a loss function when browsing through Keras documentation I found two loss functions. The first one categorical_cross_entropy was familiar, however I saw something I had never used before it was sparsed_categorical_cross_entropy.
The difference : Depends on the structure of your targets !
If your targets are one-hot encoded, you have to use categorical_crossentropy. Examples of one-hot encoding:
[1,0,0] [0,1,0] [0,0,1] But if your targets are integers, use sparse_categorical_crossentropy.</description>

      <title>Key in Min/Max function in Python</title>
      <link>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/key-in-min_max/</link>

      <guid>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/key-in-min_max/</guid>
      <description>So I was browsing TensorFlow doc on the Dataset API, when I stumbled across something which eventually led me to learn this:
You can pass a key function(or a lambda) to the min/max function in Python.
Here is a sweet example:
def sumDigit(num): sum = 0 while(num): sum += num % 10 num = int(num / 10) return sum # using min(arg1, arg2, *args, key) print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(100, 321, 267, 59, 40, key=sumDigit)) # using min(iterable, key) num = [15, 300, 2700, 821, 52, 10, 6] print(&amp;#39;Minimum is:&amp;#39;, min(num, key=sumDigit)) Source : https://www.</description>

      <title>Accessing Files in Colab</title>
      <link>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/files-in-colab/</link>

      <description>To access your Google Drive files in Colab. You first need to mount it in your notebook.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do that:
from google.colab import drive drive.mount(&amp;#39;/content/drive&amp;#39;) After this you would be asked for authorisation and provided with a token, copy and paste that token back to mount your notebook at /content/drive/ My Drive.
From this point onward you can use cd and ls to explore your drive and go where the data is.</description>

      <title>HTTP in HTTPS proxy</title>
      <link>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/http-in-https/</link>

      <guid>https://sangeet259.github.io/til/http-in-https/</guid>
      <description>Whenever I set an https_proxy, I am tempted to do something like :
https_proxy=https://172.16.2.30:8080/
Notice the &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; , sadly that&amp;rsquo;s not how it works, you have to set it &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;quot; only.
I have previously been caught in problems due to this. The latest one was when I used the https:// in the docker proxy configuration.

      <title>XClip in Fish Shell</title>

      <description>Wondered if you could just copy the output of a bash command to clipboard and paste it somewhere.
XClip is here for your rescue. The Fish Shell 3.0 now supports xclip.
How to use :
 For copying  $pwd | xclip   Paste it  $cd (xclip -o)    PS: In fish to execute a string as a command use paranthesis &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; instead of backticks &amp;quot; ` ` &amp;ldquo;.</description>
